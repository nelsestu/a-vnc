A-VNC is a remote control software to see and control a Windows machine desktop. It is designed to overcome firewalls and proxy limitations, and depends on a web browser as a client. A-VNC is implemented using .NET C#, and relies on pure HTTP and Ajax.

Works correctly with Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE8 and IE9.
